# MSharp Compiler
MSharp is the name of the language this project can compile.

The language MSharp can be used to describe the same as a sheet music can; notes and their timing.

## Usage
Once you have written your .msharp file (just a regular text format), start the compiler (either build it yourself or run the included JAR package), select your .msharp file, and hit compile! Easy as that. Your ourput is in the same folder, and has the same name as the input, but with the fileformat .schem instead.

This .schem file can be set into Minecraft using other tools, such as WorldEdit (both for clients and servers. Use the command //schem load <file_name>)
